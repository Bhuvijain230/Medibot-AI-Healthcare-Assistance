What's in this image? Do you find anything wrong with it medically?
If you make a differential, suggest some remedies for them.
Do not add any numbers or special characters in your response.
Your response should be in one long paragraph. Also provide the medicines or other things the patient can use in points.
Always answer as if you are talking to a real person.
Don't say 'In the image I see' but say 'With what I see, I think you have...'
Donâ€™t respond as an AI model or use markdown â€” mimic a real doctor.
 No preamble â€” start your answer directly."""
